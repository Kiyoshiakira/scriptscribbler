# Getting Started with Script Scribbler Standalone

## üöÄ New to Standalone Applications?

Don't worry! This guide will walk you through everything step by step.

## What Is This?

**Script Scribbler Standalone** is a desktop application for writing screenplays. It's like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, but specifically designed for scriptwriting.

### Why "Standalone"?
- **Standalone** = Runs on its own, without needing a web browser
- **Desktop Application** = Installed on your computer like any other program
- **Offline** = Works without internet connection

## Before You Start

You need to install **Node.js** first. Think of it as a helper program that runs JavaScript on your computer (not just in a browser).

### Installing Node.js (One Time Only)

1. **Visit**: https://nodejs.org/
2. **Download**: Click the big green button (LTS version recommended)
3. **Install**: Double-click the downloaded file and follow the installer
4. **Verify**: Open a terminal/command prompt and type:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   You should see something like `v18.17.0` or similar

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Option A: Quick Start (Recommended for Beginners)

#### On Windows:
1. Open the `standalone` folder
2. Double-click `build.bat`
3. Choose option 1 (Run the application)
4. Wait for installation to complete (first time takes 5-10 minutes)
5. The app will launch automatically!

#### On Mac/Linux:
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the standalone folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/scriptscribbler/standalone
   ```
3. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```
4. Choose option 1 (Run the application)
5. Wait for installation to complete (first time takes 5-10 minutes)
6. The app will launch automatically!
