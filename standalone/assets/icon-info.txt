Icon Placeholder
================

This directory should contain the application icon.

For production use, add a proper icon file named "icon.png" (at least 512x512 pixels).

The icon should represent Script Scribbler - perhaps a pen, script, or notepad design.

You can use icon generation tools like:
- electron-icon-builder
- Icon generators online
- Design your own in tools like GIMP, Photoshop, or Figma

The icon will be used for:
- Application window icon
- Taskbar/dock icon
- Desktop shortcut icon
- Installer icon
